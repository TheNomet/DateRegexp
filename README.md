This program helps out with regular expression of dates. 
Thanks to the very simple GUI, it's possible to specify the starting date, the end date and also exceptions.
It is also possible to decide format and separators.

This is an eclipse project, so the zip file must be imported as a zipped project in eclipse.
In order to use it it's enough to:
- copy DateRegexp.jar and the regexp folder in another directory;
- change the permission of the files iside the regexp directory (chmod 777 regexp/*)
- launch DateRegexp.jar using     java -jar DateRegexp.jar
